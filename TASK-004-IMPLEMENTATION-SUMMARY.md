# TASK-004: Setup Build Tools - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This task focused on configuring and validating the build tools for the
Resonance project. The project was already initialized with Vite and TypeScript,
so this task primarily involved verification and testing.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Verified Vite Configuration ✅

- React plugin properly configured with `@vitejs/plugin-react`
- Tailwind CSS plugin integrated with `@tailwindcss/vite`
- Port 5173 configured with strict port enforcement for Tauri compatibility
- Build output configured to `dist` directory with `emptyOutDir: true`
- Path aliases configured for `@` to map to `./src`

### 2. Verified TypeScript Configuration ✅

- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Target set to ES2020
- JSX transform configured to use `react-jsx`
- Path aliases configured with baseUrl and paths
- Linting rules enabled (noUnusedLocals, noUnusedParameters)
- Module resolution set to bundler mode

### 3. Tested Build Process ✅

- Successfully ran `npm run build`
- Build generates output in `dist` directory
- Creates optimized JavaScript and CSS bundles
- Generates index.html

### 4. Tested Hot Module Replacement ✅

- HMR working correctly with Vite dev server
- Changes to React components update instantly
- Console shows hot update messages

### 5. Created Comprehensive Tests ✅

- Added test file: `src/__tests__/build-config.test.ts`
- Tests verify TypeScript configuration
- Tests verify Vite configuration
- Tests verify build output structure
- Tests verify path alias resolution
- All 12 tests passing

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed JSON Comments**: Cleaned up `tsconfig.json` by removing comments to
   make it valid JSON, which simplified test parsing.

2. **Added Build Configuration Tests**: Created comprehensive test suite
   following TDD approach to verify all build tool configurations.

## Success Criteria Met

- [x] Vite configured for React
- [x] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [x] Path aliases configured
- [x] Build process working
- [x] Hot module replacement working

## Technical Details

### Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)

```typescript
- React plugin for JSX transformation
- Tailwind CSS plugin for styling
- Path alias: @ → ./src
- Fixed port 5173 for Tauri
- Output to dist directory
```

### TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`)

```json
- Strict mode: true
- Target: ES2020
- JSX: react-jsx
- Module resolution: bundler
- Path aliases configured
```

## Next Steps

With build tools properly configured and tested, the project is ready for the
next phase. According to the dependency graph, TASK-005 (Setup Testing
Framework) would be the logical next step, building on this foundation.
